# Sound Files

This folder contains sound effects for the website.

## Required Files:

- **postal.mp3** - Sound for POSTAL 2 card (both hover and click)
- **counterstrike.mp3** - Sound for Counter-Strike: Source card (both hover and click)

## Placeholder Notice:

Currently these files are missing. The code is ready but sounds will be silently ignored until you add actual audio files here.

### Recommended Format: **MP3**

**Why MP3?**
- Universal browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, mobile)
- Excellent compression for small file sizes
- Quality loss is imperceptible for short UI sound effects
- Fast loading and decoding

**Avoid FLAC:**
- Not supported in all browsers (Safari doesn't support it)
- Much larger file sizes (5-10x bigger than MP3)
- Overkill quality for short UI sounds
- Slower loading times

### Recommended Specs:
- **Format:** MP3
- **Bitrate:** 128kbps or 192kbps (more than enough)
- **Length:** 0.1-0.5 seconds
- **Sample Rate:** 44.1kHz
- **Volume:** Pre-normalized to avoid being too loud
- **Target Size:** Under 20KB each

### Suggested Sounds:
- **POSTAL 2:** Something gritty/edgy (gunshot, weapon sound, voice clip)
- **Counter-Strike:** Tactical sound (weapon switch, reload click, radio beep)
